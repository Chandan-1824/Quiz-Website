            <h2>About The Project</h2>
            <p id="poject">This is a basic Quiz website. Here you can take different quiz test depending on your preference , Although there are only four questions in every topic, and the reason for that is, we created this website just to test our knowledge & skill. Maybe in future we will add some new features but right now we don't really have any plan for it. If you like this website and want to use it feel free to use it for your projects.
